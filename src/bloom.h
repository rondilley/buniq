 * -----------
 *     bloom   - Pointer to an allocated struct bloom (see above).
 *     entries - The expected number of entries which will be inserted.
 *               Must be at least 1000 (in practice, likely much larger).
 *     error   - Probability of collision (as long as entries are not
 *               exceeded).
